# DuckDuckGo-Fakeshops-Blocklist
This blocklist is used to protect yourself from the fake / affiliate shop that appeared on the German version DuckDuckGo.

I noticed that on the German version of DuckDuckGo more and more fakeshop / affiliate shops appeared. I had contacted DuckDuckGo on Twitter/X, but unfortunately the company had not responded.

That's why I've created a blocklist that you can <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Monstanner/DuckDuckGo-Fakeshops-Blocklist/main/Blockliste">here</A> can be watched. If available, you can then add them to your RasPi or adblocker.

This blocklist is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and can therefore be forked.
